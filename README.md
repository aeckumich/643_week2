# Assignment 2
## Austin Eck 

The goal of this script is to plot the rolling batting average of different 
baseball players. Five players are provided in the `Data` directory.

The script requires two arguments from the command line. 
1. The name of the output file e.g. `AaronJudge.png`. The path to the 
directory is included by default, so the only requirement is the name of the file. 
2. A list of players names that we want to see plotted. This can be accomplished by using 
`--values "Aaron Judge" "Freddie Freeman"`. 

An example command is: 

`python main.py chart.png --values 'Aaron Judge'`

Requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. 

This script modifies the original notebook found in the `Source Notebook Directory.`
